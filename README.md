# Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Pipeline Project with TensorFlow Extended (TFX)

## Project Overview
This project utilizes **[TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx)**, a powerful end-to-end platform designed to implement production-ready machine learning pipelines. This project focuses on building a data pipeline for the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset, emphasizing feature preparation and analysis.

## Objectives
During this project, you will:
- **Create an InteractiveContext** to run TFX components interactively.
- **Use TFX ExampleGen** to split the dataset into training and evaluation datasets.
- **Generate and analyze dataset statistics** using TFX StatisticsGen.
- **Validate the dataset schema** with TFX SchemaGen.
- **Ensure dataset quality** using TFX ExampleValidator.
- **Perform feature engineering** using TFX Transform.
